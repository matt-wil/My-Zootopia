# Zootopia
This program searches through the Animals API for a users input animal.
It will retrieve all the data of any animal in the database with users input.
the program then prints a list of the skin types of all animals retrieved and if you like you can either choose a certain skin_type or you can input all.
then the program serializes all the data into a html file and writes said data to the html file. 
if no data was retrieved from the api there is a little link waiting for you.
